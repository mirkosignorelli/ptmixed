## What is ptmixed
`ptmixed` is as `R` package that allows to estimate the Poisson-Tweedie generalized linear mixed model presented in Signorelli, Spitali and Tsonaka (2020, in press). Poisson-Tweedie mixed-effects model: a flexible approach for the analysis of longitudinal RNA-seq data. *Statistical Modelling*, DOI: 10.1177/1471082X20936017. You can [freely read and download the paper here](https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X20936017) (the article is published with open access, so you don't need a subscription to access it).

## About this repository
This repository contains data and code to reproduce the simulations presented in Signorelli, Spitali and Tsonaka (2020).
