# Poisson-Tweedie mixed-effects model: flexible modelling of longitudinal overdispersed counts

## What is ptmixed
ptmixed is as R package that allows to estimate the Poisson-Tweedie generalized linear mixed model presented in Signorelli, Spitali and Tsonaka (2020, in press). Poisson-Tweedie mixed-effects model: a flexible approach for the analysis of longitudinal RNA-seq data. To appear in *Statistical Modelling*.
